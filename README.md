Buzz Bomber is a simple arcade-style game inspired by the classic 1983 title.
In this version, the player controls a spray can that shoots at incoming bees while avoiding obstacles and preventing honeycombs from piling up. Each defeated bee turns into a honeycomb that can be collected by a hummingbird for extra points.
